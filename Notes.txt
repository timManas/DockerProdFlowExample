56. This is now the recommended way to generate an app with Create React App.

Instead of this:

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app client

Just do this:

npx create-react-app client

57. How to create a react app ?
npx create-react-app frontend


57. Node Stuff
nom run start - Starts up a development server. Only for dev uese only
npm run test - Runs tests associated with the project
npm run build - Builds a production version of the application

58. How to set up a production Flow with docker ?
1. Create
Dockerfile.dev -> Only for dev env
Dockerfile -> For production env



59. If multiple docker files include use -f "Specify which docker file"
> docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .    ---- Don't forget the "."

60. Remember running the docker build ... will create a Docker image =) Then from the image you can start a container using docker run 
- However, you will to PORT over your port 3000 
Ex docker run -p 3000:3000 951a83499a04

61. 
How to Execute 
docker run -p 3000:3000 951a83499a04

-p : Stands for port forward

Notes
1. You will need to have Dockerfile in code 
2. You will need to run           
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .    
3. You will need to run using 
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app 

How to allow for dynamic loading when code changes instead of having to rebuild container
- You will need to use docker volumes 


62. What is a docker volume ?
- It is  reference to a folder outside a container
- Similar to mapping where to map ports to outside container
- Volumes a have a reference to folders outside containers

63. docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app

64. The -v without the ":" is a bookmark on the node_modules folder which will NOT try to map into anything else 

65. You can use docker compose to minimize the command when using docker volume ("-v")

66. Docker compose can do the build and the run of the file when you execute
> docker-compose up 


67. How to execute the tests in docker file ?
docker run -it 10123c900599 npm run test

68. docker attach - Attaches the stdin, stdout and stereo of the container 

69. Why do we need to use Nginx ?
Tradiationally
Client -> Container (WebServer -> Index.Html + main.js)

However, when running npm run build:
The WebServer is not gone, hence we need to replace the Webserver with something else 

Enter....NGINX

Now
Client -> Container(NGINX -> index.Html + main.js)

70. You can run multi step build process 
Build Phase
1. use node:alpine
2. Copy package.json file
3. Install dependencies
4. Run nom run build

Run Phase
1. Use nginx
2. Copy over results of npm run build
3. Start nginx


72. How to execute Production Build on Docker
docker build .   # Notice how we don't have the -f flag since the production grade itself is just Dockerfile instead of Dockerfile.dev
> docker build .
> docker run -p 8080:80 40b774e6452e
